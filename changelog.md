## [Unreleased]

- Feat: added dark/light theme toggle button in top bar next to tabs; choice persists in localStorage and overrides server default

### 0.16.0

- Feat: Added `DEFAULT_TAB` env variable to set default tab on load (`translate`, `language-check`, or `harper`). Takes precedence over localStorage when set.
- Feat: Added `DEFAULT_TARGET_LANGUAGE` env variable to set default translation target language (ISO 639 code)
- Chore: Updated package name from `sth-libretranslate` to `omnipoly`
- Test: Added tests for new default settings features (19 new tests)

### 0.15.0

### 0.14.4

- Fix: when `DISABLE_DICTIONARY=true` languagetool was not returning any response.
- Fix: recreated sync between input fields between tabs which was lost during zustand migration.

### 0.14.3

- Fix: during the creation of improved fix tooltip I've introduced a bug that completely broke position where text is fixed. This is fixed now. 
- Feat: added picky level in language tool (use an ENV to enable it)
- Feat: added DEBUG mode to log all requests

### 0.14.2

- Chore: suggest different backend for languagetool. Apparently the one in readme wasn't the best.

### 0.14.1

- Fix: when user wanted to use only libretranslate the whole app crashed due to invalid tab choices.

### 0.14.0

- Fix: enforce font color (chrome bug) on text-area, based on theme. No more dark text on dark bg

    This also allowed:
    - Better styling for error highliht
    - Additional tooltip with quick peek of the issue and and quick (up to 4) click to fix resolutions (sidebar gives more options if language tool provides)

### 0.12.0

- Introduced a new environment variable `DISABLE_DICTIONARY`. When this variable is set to true, the functionality for adding words to the dictionary is disabled.
- **Enhanced Text Interaction:** In the language tool, highlighted text segments are now interactive. Clicking on these segments opens sidebar suggestion.
- **Improved Editing Experience:** During the editing process in the language tool, the highlight automatically disappears as it becomes invalid once modifications have been initiated.
